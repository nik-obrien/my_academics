Welcome to the repository!

The reasons I choose to type and share my solutions to textbook problems are simple:
	1. Though I now work as a programmer I still love engaging with math and physics.
	2. Solving problems is fun and relaxing for me.
	3. It keeps my mind sharp!

Please note all solutions are my own original work. Some solutions may contain errors or be incorrect. If you find such a solution you may email me at

	nikolas.j.obrien@gmail.com

and I will be happy to make the changes and give you credit. If you are currently a student and find yourself using my solutions to help you in homework
I strongly encourage you to attempt the problems on your own first and only use my work for confirmation or better understanding if you get stuck.
