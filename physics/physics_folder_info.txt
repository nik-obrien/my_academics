Welcome to the Physics section of this repository!

Each focus will be given a folder (Classical Mechanics, Electrodynamics, Quantum Mechanics etc.)

	Every focus folder will contain three sub-folders (Notes, Proofs, Solutions)

Here I will also list the textbooks used for each focus:
	Classical Mechanics  - Classical Mechanics (1st Edition) by John R. Taylor
