Academics - Repository Description

My educational background is in Physics and Math and even though I now work as a programmer I still deeply love the academic pursuits of those fields.

During my freetime I enjoy typing my formal notes and problem solutions in LaTeX and sharing them with the public.

During my time as a graduate student I had the privilege of teaching this material to undergraduate students and found I had a real skill and passion for it. 

So I hope these notes/proofs/problem soltuions and whatever else I decide to share here help the next generation of students in STEM.
