Academics - Repository Description

My educational background is in Physics and Math and even though I now work as a programmer I still deeply love the academic pursuits of those fields.

My initial aim with this repositroy is to post my own original worked solutions to numerous textbook problems (see explanation_of_solutions.txt).

In the future I will consider posting typed proofs and/or course notes that I've taken in an effort to share my understanding of the topics at hand.

All work is coded in LaTeX using Overleaf.
